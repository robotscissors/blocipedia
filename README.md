# Blocipedia
This App is a robust rails project exercising the basics of Rails’ CRUD flexibility. The App functions as a Wiki markdown site that allows users to create both public and private Wikis based on the user role. In addition, there is the option of using an upgrade service to upgrade a standard account to a premium role.

## Devise Login
Using the Devise gem allows for easy integration of user management.

## Upgrade using the STRIPE Gem
Feature upgrades were managed by using STRIPE, a payment solution. This was a little more tricky but the strip gem made it quick to get a demo going.

## Features and Gems
One of the best things about using rails is all of the helper libraries and Gems that can be installed. It really simplifies the creating of complex web applications, and makes it just a little bit less tedious and abstracts a lot of the complexities.

User roles and accounts were fairly easy to create, manage and integrate into the application using Devise. Without a doubt, it was easy to install and made validation in the application surprisingly a breeze.


## Challenges
I think the biggest challenge is with TDD. I really love the idea of TDD and BDD. Test driven development is smart and goals and benefits are crystal clear. Personally, I feel like it isn’t as intuitive as it should be and I strive to be a better tester.

## Conclusion
This application was an excellent example of the power of Rails. It really speaks to why startups choose this platform to create effective and swift production code. It really didn’t take that long to build, but if I had more time I would spend more time on the look and feel.
